Hi! My name is Tanish Parida and I'm a rising sophomore at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. I am interested in math, coding, and astronomy/astrophysics. In my free time, I like to watch a lot of soccer (go Arsenal!) and play various sports/games with my friends. Please check out the other parts of this website for some of the projects I've worked on and my personal blog.
